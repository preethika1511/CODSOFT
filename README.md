# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project contains information about the passengers, including their demographics and ticket details.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that determines whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on various features such as age, sex, passenger class, and more. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning model building.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). It includes the following columns:

- **PassengerId**: Unique ID for each passenger
- **Survived**: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- **Name**: Passenger's name
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard
- **Ticket**: Ticket number
- **Fare**: Fare paid
- **Cabin**: Cabin number (if available)
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Exploration and Cleaning
- Load the dataset and inspect its structure.
- Handle missing values using imputation techniques.
- Convert categorical data into numerical form where necessary.
- Remove or transform irrelevant features.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Use visualizations to explore relationships between features.
- Generate summary statistics to understand data distribution.
- Identify trends that may impact survival probability.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Create new features to enhance model performance.
- Perform encoding for categorical variables.
- Scale numerical features where necessary.

### 4. Model Building
- Train multiple machine learning models, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
- Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive coding environment
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning model development

## Results and Conclusion
The Titanic Survival Prediction project successfully demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to real-world datasets. Through data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training, an accurate predictive model was developed. The project highlights:

- The impact of different features (such as gender and class) on survival rates.
- The importance of handling missing data and choosing relevant features.
- The effectiveness of different machine learning models in classification problems.

# Credit Card Fraud Detection 🏦💳

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Credit Card Fraud Detection** project aims to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using **data analysis** and **machine learning techniques**. Financial fraud is a significant issue, and detecting fraudulent transactions is essential for reducing financial losses and ensuring transaction security. 

This project uses a **supervised learning approach**, leveraging historical transaction data to train a model that can differentiate between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.

📥 Importing Libraries
The following Python libraries are used for data manipulation, visualization, and model building:

python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
📂 Loading the Dataset
python
Copy
Edit
data = pd.read_csv("creditcard.csv")
The dataset consists of 284,807 transactions with 30 features.

🗂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following important columns:

Time: The time elapsed since the first transaction in the dataset.

V1 to V28: Features obtained from Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

Amount: The transaction amount.

Class: The target variable (1 → Fraudulent, 0 → Non-Fraudulent).

🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
🔹 Checking for Missing Values
python
Copy
Edit
data.isnull().sum()
The dataset does not contain any missing values.

🔹 Class Distribution
python
Copy
Edit
sns.countplot(x="Class", data=data)
plt.title("Distribution of Fraudulent and Non-Fraudulent Transactions")
plt.show()
Fraudulent transactions account for only 0.17% of the dataset, making it highly imbalanced.

🔹 Transaction Amount Distribution
python
Copy
Edit
sns.histplot(data["Amount"], bins=50, kde=True)
plt.title("Transaction Amount Distribution")
plt.show()
The majority of transactions are of small amounts, with some high-value transactions.

🏗 Feature Engineering
Since V1 to V28 are PCA-transformed, we focus on scaling the Amount feature:

from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

scaler = StandardScaler()
data["Amount"] = scaler.fit_transform(data[["Amount"]])
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets:

python
Copy
Edit
X = data.drop(columns=["Class"])
y = data["Class"]

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
🧠 Model Building
Training a Random Forest Classifier:
python
Copy
Edit
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
📊 Model Evaluation
🔹 Making Predictions
python
Copy
Edit
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
🔹 Classification Report
python
Copy
Edit
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
🔹 Confusion Matrix
python
Copy
Edit
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt="d", cmap="Blues")
plt.xlabel("Predicted")
plt.ylabel("Actual")
plt.title("Confusion Matrix")
plt.show()
✅ Results and Conclusion
The Random Forest model performs well in detecting fraudulent transactions.

Precision and Recall are key metrics since the dataset is highly imbalanced.

The project successfully demonstrates fraud detection using machine learning.

🚧 Challenges and Improvements
⚠ Challenges:
Class Imbalance: Since fraudulent transactions are very rare, the model might be biased.

Overfitting: Some models may perform too well on training data, but fail on unseen data.
