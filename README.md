# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project contains information about the passengers, including their demographics and ticket information.

## Aim

The main goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can determine whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on various features such as age, sex, passenger class, and other relevant attributes.

## What is Given

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). The dataset contains the following columns:

- **PassengerId**: Unique ID for each passenger
- **Survived**: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- **Name**: Name of the passenger
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
- **Ticket**: Ticket number
- **Fare**: Fare paid by the passenger
- **Cabin**: Cabin number
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## What is Done in the Project

### 1. Data Exploration and Cleaning
- The dataset is loaded and explored to understand its structure and contents.
- Missing values are identified and handled appropriately.
- Data types are checked and corrected if necessary.
- The dataset is cleaned and prepared for analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Various visualizations are created to explore the relationships between features.
- Summary statistics are computed to understand the distribution of data.
- Insights are drawn from the data to guide the modeling process.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- New features are created based on existing data to improve model performance.
- Irrelevant or redundant features are removed.
- Feature scaling and encoding are performed to prepare the data for modeling.

### 4. Model Building
- Several machine learning models are evaluated, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.
- The models are trained and validated using appropriate metrics.
- Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize model performance.


## Tools Used

- **Python**: The main programming language used for this project.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive environment for running Python code.
- **Pandas**: A library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical computations.
- **Seaborn**: A library for data visualization.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Scikit-learn**: A library for machine learning, including tools for model building, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Conclusion

The Titanic Survival Prediction project successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. Through data exploration, feature engineering, and model building, a predictive model is developed that achieves good performance on the dataset. The project highlights the importance of data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation in building effective machine learning models.

This project serves as a comprehensive example of how to approach a machine learning problem, from data exploration to model deployment. The insights gained and the techniques applied can be extended to other similar classification problems in different domains.
